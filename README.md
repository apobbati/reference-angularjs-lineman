/**
 *  This file is here as the result of angular.module() 's behavior
 *
 *  You can only declare a module's  dependencies once, so we need to bootstrap
 *  the list of all modules and their dependencies here.
 *
 *  The directory structure for modules should be by module name.
 *  Sub modules should be under sub-diretories.
 *
 *  For example:
 *
 *  Module myapp.home and all its controllers, directives, services, and so on
 *  will be defined in an directory called myapp/home
 *
 *  This will make it easier for quickly navigate.
 *
 *  Guidelines for creating controllers:
 *
 *  Keep ONE of the following per FILE:
 *    - Controller
 *    - Directive
 *    - Service
 *    - Factory
 *    - Resource
 *    - Model
 *
 *  The name of the file will match the name of the unit above.
 *  Follow camel-case with the first letter capitalized.
 *
 *  The only exception is module.js which will reside in every module, and will
 *  just define the signature of the module (i.e. the dependencies it has)
